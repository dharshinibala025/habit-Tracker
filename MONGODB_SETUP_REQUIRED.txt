🚨 IMPORTANT: MongoDB Atlas IP Whitelisting Required!
====================================================

Your application is ready to run, but MongoDB Atlas needs your IP address whitelisted.

QUICK FIX (2 minutes):
----------------------

1. Open: https://cloud.mongodb.com/
2. Login with your MongoDB Atlas account
3. Click "Network Access" (left sidebar)
4. Click "ADD IP ADDRESS" button
5. Click "ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE" 
   (or add your specific IP)
6. Click "Confirm"
7. Wait 1-2 minutes

That's it! Then run: start-app.bat

WHY IS THIS NEEDED?
-------------------
MongoDB Atlas blocks all connections by default for security.
You need to tell it which IP addresses can connect to your database.

ALTERNATIVE: Add Specific IP
-----------------------------
If you don't want to allow all IPs:
1. Go to https://www.whatismyip.com/
2. Copy your IP address
3. In MongoDB Atlas Network Access, click "Add IP Address"
4. Paste your IP and click "Confirm"

VERIFICATION:
-------------
After whitelisting, test the connection:
  cd server
  node test-connection.js

You should see: "✅ MongoDB Connected Successfully!"
